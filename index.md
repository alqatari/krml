## News Outline

- I have been **awarded** an [**NWO Top Grant**](http://www.nwo.nl/actueel/nieuws/2016/ew/63-miljoen-top-subsidie-voor-18-exacte-topwetenschappers.html) to conduct "innovative or high-risk scientific research that addresses questions of high quality and urgency;" I will push the boundaries of large-scale collaborative search! The grant funds a 4-year PhD position and extras. <img src="../img/grant.png" height="40px">
- I am acting as Program Chair for the [39th European Conference on Information Retrieval](http://ecir2017.org/).
- I am organizing the [15th Dutch-Belgian Information Retrieval Workshop](http://dir2016.nl); the preliminary program is [already available (PDF)](https://chauff.github.io/dir2016/DIR2016_Program_v1.pdf)
- At [ACM SIGIR 2016](http://sigir.org/sigir2016/) I co-organized a workshop on **Search as Learning** together with Jacek Gwizdka, Preben Hansen, Jiyin He and Noriko Kando. The workshop proceedings are [available through CEUR](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1647/). I am also a guest editor of a [special issue (PDF)](http://chauff.github.io/sal2016/CfP_SI_Search_As_Learning.pdf) on the topic in Springer's [Information Retrieval Journal](http://link.springer.com/journal/10791) as well as a co-organizer of a [Dagstuhl Seminar](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/dagstuhl-seminars/) on Search As Learning in Spring 2017.
- My team's learning analytics research is taking off with **six** recent full paper acceptances at [ACM UMAP 2016](http://www.um.org/umap2016/), [ACM WebScience 2016](http://websci16.org/), [EDM 2016](http://www.educationaldatamining.org/EDM2016/), [ACM L@S 2016](http://learningatscale.acm.org/las2016/) and 2x [ECTEL 2016](http://www.ec-tel.eu/index.php?id=732). The ACM L@S paper led by Guanliang Chen received an **Honorable Mention**, the ECTEL paper led by Dan Davis received the **Best Student Paper Award**. <img src="../img/award.png" height="30px"><img src="../img/award.png" height="30px">

## Briefly

Since 2013, I have been working as Assistant Professor (tenured as of 01/2016) at the [Web Information Systems group](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/),
 [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl/). Between 2011 and 2012 I was a Postdoc in the same group.
I received my PhD in 2010 from the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/), where I worked in the 
[Human Media Interaction group](http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/). 
The [Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg](https://www.uni-magdeburg.de/) in Germany was 
my home during my undergraduate years as a student in computer science.
In the past, I have worked on a variety of topics in the fields of information retrieval & data science, 
including query performance prediction (the topic of [my PhD thesis](../documents/publications/thesis.pdf)), 
social search, computational social science, 
learning to search and IR for specific user groups.

I have diverse research interests and am always happy to dive into a new area. Together with three PhD students 
I am supervising (Guanliang Chen, Yue Zhao and Dan Davis), I am currently focusing heavily on large-scale learning analytics and how to incorporate search into the learning process at scale (after all, I am an *IR* researcher!). TU Delft is a very active provider of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on the edX platform, which provides a rich experimental playground; ultimately, I and the whole [WIS Learning Analytics team](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/projects/learning-analytics/) I lead, aim to provide insights and develop mechanisms to improve learning at scale. To get a quick overview of the kind of questions we have recently published about, take a look at the following slides, they cover each contribution in 1-2 slides:

If you are looking for collaborations in the crossover between learning analytics and IR, please get in touch.
