## MSc thesis supervision

Students I have supervised and am currently supervising are researching a range of topics related to information retrieval and 
learning analytics including spelling correction, big data architectures, topic modeling, query log analysis and cheating in MOOCs. 
Several of my students have published their MSc work at high-quality conference venues, including ICWE, ACM SIGIR and ACM HyperText.

If you are interested in a Master thesis research project in information retrieval, have a look at the ongoing benchmark 
campaigns - often a good starting point for finding a topic in information retrieval:

- [MediaEval](http://www.multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2016/)
- [SemEval](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/)
- [CLEF](http://clef2016.clef-initiative.eu/)
- [TREC](http://trec.nist.gov/)
- [NTCIR](http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/index-en.html)

If you are interested in a thesis in learning analytics, have a look at the proceedings of the [first](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2556325) and [second edition](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2724660) 
of the ACM Learning At Scale conference - they contain many interesting contributions in terms of data science and Web engineering
in the domain of massive open online learning. 
 
## Courses
 
 Below are the resources I have developed for my courses (some are more up-to-date than others): 
 *Big Data Processing*, *Web and Database Technology* and *Information Retrieval*.

### Big Data Processing

Since 2013/2014 I have been teaching the second year Bachelor course *Big Data Processing* at TU Delft. 
The course covers a range of technologies in the Hadoop ecosystem after a short excursion into the streaming world; 
I created the material based on a number of great books, including [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://www.mmds.org/),
[Data-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce](https://lintool.github.io/MapReduceAlgorithms/), 
[Hadoop: The Definite Guide](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033448.do), [Programming Pig](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001811/index.html)
and [ZooKeeper](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028901.do).

### Web (and Database) Technology
Since 2013/2014 I have also been teaching the first year Bachelor course *Web and Database Technology* at TU Delft, together with
[Alessandro Bozzon](http://alessandrobozzon.com/). I teach the Web technology part, which turned out to be quite a challenge due to
the wide variety of skill sets our incoming students possess (some work as Web developers, others have never written a single line of HTML
before the start of this course). To level the playing field for the more than 300 students we have every year, we rely on the [Learning Web App Development](http://learningwebappdev.com/)
book, which introduces the modern Web stack in an accessible and practical manner. The lectures build on the material introduced
in the book.

### Information Retrieval
In 2011/12 I taught my core area of research in a Master course *Information Retrieval* at TU Delft. This course was my first excursion
into the use of Hadoop & Co as part of my teaching, thanks to a grant from Amazon and their (at the time) "AWS Education" scheme - $3500
to allow students to use a real Hadoop cluster for their experiments.  

The course material is quite old by now, but it may still be useful to some. It was also my first venture into the 
teaching of large classes, the structure and design of the course certainly reflects that.
